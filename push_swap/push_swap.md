**Gemini's Explanation:**

The "push_swap" project is a sorting algorithm challenge. Here's a summary based on the material you provided:

**The Goal:**

The main objective is to sort a list of unique integers given as command-line arguments. You need to write a program called `push_swap` that takes these numbers, which are initially in a stack named `a`, and sorts them in ascending order. The catch is that you must use a limited set of specific operations and your program should output the sequence of these operations that results in a sorted stack `a`. The challenge lies in finding the *shortest* possible sequence of operations.

**The Stacks:**

You'll work with two stacks:

*   **Stack `a`**: Initially contains the unsorted, unique integers.
*   **Stack `b`**: Initially empty. You can use this stack as a temporary holding space to help with sorting.

**The Operations:**

You are allowed to use the following operations to manipulate the stacks:

*   **`sa`**: Swaps the top two elements of stack `a`.
*   **`sb`**: Swaps the top two elements of stack `b`.
*   **`ss`**: Performs `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
*   **`pa`**: Takes the top element from stack `b` and puts it on top of stack `a`.
*   **`pb`**: Takes the top element from stack `a` and puts it on top of stack `b`.
*   **`ra`**: Rotates stack `a` up (the first element becomes the last).
*   **`rb`**: Rotates stack `b` up.
*   **`rr`**: Performs `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
*   **`rra`**: Reverse rotates stack `a` down (the last element becomes the first).
*   **`rrb`**: Reverse rotates stack `b` down.
*   **`rrr`**: Performs `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.

**Program Details:**

*   Your `push_swap` program should print the sequence of operations to standard output, one operation per line.
*   It needs to handle errors like non-integer arguments, duplicates, or values outside the integer range by printing "Error" to the standard error stream.
*   There are performance benchmarks. For example, to get a full score, you need to be able to sort 100 random numbers in fewer than 700 operations and 500 numbers in under 5500 operations.

**Bonus:**

There is an optional bonus part where you create a second program called `checker`. This program will:

1.  Take the same initial list of numbers as an argument.
2.  Read a list of operations from the standard input.
3.  Execute these operations on the stacks.
4.  Print "OK" if stack `a` is sorted and stack `b` is empty, and "KO" otherwise.

This `checker` program is used to verify if the sequence of operations generated by your `push_swap` program is correct.
